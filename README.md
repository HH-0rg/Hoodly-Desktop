Hoodly desktop aims to bring together like minded people within college campuses. As a college student, I have never met or interacted with more than 90% of the people in campus, many of whom might share a lot me with and would've been a blast to be around.

  Hoodly tends to do just that.

Users can Create "Communities" related to anything they are interested in.
One can look through the active list of communities in the college and join any that interests him. Joining checks will be optional.

Here's the cool part

Once a week, the community meets up for an event of sorts. Be it a night-long bingewatch, a coding sprint or a reading session or just a regular night-out, these events offer the community members a chance to mingle and meet like-minded people.

When a non-member looks up the community, he will be greeted with photos of the past events and a brief description of what they do
